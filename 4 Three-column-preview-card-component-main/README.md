## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was relatively similar to the card component challenge (challenge #1) and the stats preview component card (challenge #3). I didn't learn new things, but I did strength my existing skills especailly with flexbox and mobile first development. I started off with only mobile design. When that design was completed, I added few lines to the media query responsible for the desktop design. I saw the benefit of doing one at a time and not try to do both simultaneously.
