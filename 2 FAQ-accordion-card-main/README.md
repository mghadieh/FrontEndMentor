## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

The major learning milestone achieved in this project was vanilla JS. I went through a full course on LinkedIn learn called JavaScript Essential Training[https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training/]. I part of the concepts learned in the course in this project and definitely going to be using the knowledge aquired in this course in future projects and challenges.

### Continued development

For the next and future projects, I will continue to practice my CSS styling in general [requires continued developement of CSS]. This is the first project that has JS built into it, so that also needs more practice to have a better grip on JS concepts and coding.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/] - This helped me in understanding new concepts in CSS and JS that were new to me.
- [https://stackoverflow.com/] - To see solutions for issues faced by others.
- [https://youtube.com/] - Used as a last resort if none of the previous resources were enough.
