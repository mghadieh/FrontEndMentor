## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is the first challenge I complete %100 by myself ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.
I solidified my CSS knowledge especially widths and flexbox.

### Continued development

For future projects, I will continue to use Flexbox where possible until I hone down my CSS skills. After that, I will start to use Grid. Long term plans is to learn a CSS framework (not sure which yet).

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-properties) - This helped me with setting up the flexbox properties. I really liked this website and will use it going forward.
