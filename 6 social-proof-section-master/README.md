## My process

Due to the layout of the mobile page, I thought I would use CSS Grid to build the page. After couple of hours of struggling, I decided to switch back to CSS Flexbox. It was much easier to manipulate while building the mobile version. More CSS code was required for building the desktop version than I expected, but it was done.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflowstyles

### What I learned

I learnt that I need to follow my insticts and find the simplest solution to the problems.

### Continued development

My skills are improving and I am getting more confident in facing challenges and looking for solutions.
